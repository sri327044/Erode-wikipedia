    <p>Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve is a protected area and tiger reserve located along the area straddling both the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats in the Erode district of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.[1] The Sathyamangalam Forest Division is part of the Bramhagiri-Nilgiris-Eastern Ghats Elephant Reserve notified in 2003.[2] In 2008, part of the Sathyamangalam Forest Division was declared a wildlife sanctuary, which was further enlarged in 2011 to cover a forest area of 1,411.6 km2 (545.0 sq mi). It is the largest wildlife sanctuary in Tamil Nadu.[3] In 2013, an area of 1,408.6 km2 (543.9 sq mi) of the erstwhile sanctuary was notified as a tiger reserve and it was the fourth tiger reserve established in the state as a part of Project Tiger. <br><br>

        The reserve is a significant ecosystem and a wildlife corridor in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve between the Western Ghats and the Eastern Ghats and a genetic link between the five other protected areas which it adjoins, including the Sigur Plateau, Mudumalai and Bandipur National Parks, Billigiriranga Swamy Temple and Cauvery Wildlife Sanctuaries. The reserve covers parts of Sathyamangalam and Gobichettipalayam taluks of Erode district in western Tamil Nadu. <br><br>
        
        The reserve had a tiger population of 80 individuals in 2018 which was 25 in 2011.[4] In 2022, the reserve won the TX2 award by World Wide Fund in collaboration with wildlife conservation agencies for its growth in tiger population.<br><br>
        
        History
        Patches of sandalwood reserves including the Sathyamangalam forests were notified under the Indian Forest Act, 1927. The forests were part of the erstwhile Coimbatore district with a range officer at Sathyamangalam and eight guards.[6] The forest division is currently located in Erode district and forms a part of the Brahmagiri-Nilgiris-Eastern Ghats elephant reserve notified in 2003.[2] Sathyamangalam Forest Division was declared a wildlife sanctuary with effect from 3 November 2008 by the Government of Tamil Nadu as per the Wild Life Protection Act of 1972.[7] In 2008, the Government of Karnataka sent a proposal to declare the contiguous Billigiriranga Swamy Temple Wildlife Sanctuary as a tiger reserve which was subsequently approved in 2010.[8][9] In a wildlife survey conducted by the Government of Tamil Nadu in 2010, 46 tigers were sighted in the Sathyamangalam forest area.[10] In July 2010, the Minister of State for Environment and Forests of the Government of India requested the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu to consider the possibility of proposing the Sathyamangalam wildlife sanctuary as a Project Tiger reserve as per the provisions of the Wildlife Protection Act of 1972 as the area is contiguous with the forests of Bandipur and Mudumalai tiger reserves.[11][8] On 1 April 2010, the Government of Tamil Nadu announced that it would initiate the process to declare the sanctuary as a tiger reserve because of the consistent sighting of tigers in the forest area and that the declaration would strengthen wildlife conservation efforts, as the central government would provide additional financial support for the appointment of additional anti-poaching watchers and for the establishment of anti-poaching camps. <br><br>
        
        On 10 March 2011, the Principal Chief Conservator of Forests said that the proposal for according tiger reserve status for the Sathyamangalam reserve forests is under consideration. He said that studies using camera traps indicated there could be 19 to 25 tigers in the forests. A 2011 camera trap tiger density study conducted by World Wildlife Fund indicated that the sanctuary is home to at least 25 tigers.[13] In the same year, a DNA based project initiated by the state forest department collected 150 samples of pugmarks from the Sathyamangalam forests and 69 of them were found positive for tigers by tests conducted at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology in Hyderabad. The findings also indicated that the region was home to as many as 30 tigers.<br><br>
        
        Supported by the reports of tiger sightings, the Tamil Nadu Forest Department submitted a detailed report to the state government supporting the proposal to declare the sanctuary as a tiger reserve and the proposal was taken up for consideration by the Tamil Nadu Council of Ministers in early 2012.[14] On 6 April 2012, the Chief Wildlife Warden said that the proposal to declare Sathyamangalam as a tiger reserve has been sent to the Ministry of Environment and Forests for approval and funding.[15] In March 2013, the Government of India issued an order declaring the Sathyamangalam Wildlife Sanctuary as the fourth tiger reserve in the state, with the other three being Mudumalai, Indira Gandhi National Park and Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve.
