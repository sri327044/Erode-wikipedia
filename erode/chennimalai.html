            The temple of Chennimalai is situated on the banks of Noyyal also called Kânchima Nadhi. The Sanctum
            Sanctorum faces the east. Just in front of the temple, one finds the Puliyadi Vinâyagar. Inside the temple

            the shrines of Kasi Viswanâthar and Visâlâkshi.

            The steps behind Moolavar Sannidhi lead to the Valli Teyvannai Temple. The two consorts enshrined in a
            separate temple constitute a unique phenomenon. The Punnâkau Siddhar cave with the front yard filled with
            'Vel' of different sizes and shapes is on top of the hill. This Siddhar is one of the popular 18 Siddhas
            known to the world for their Siddha yoga. Saravana Mâmunivar's tomb is near the cave. There is an old cave
            near this temple.
