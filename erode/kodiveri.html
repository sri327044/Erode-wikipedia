        <p> The waterfalls at the bottom of the Kodiveri Dam are a spectacular place with beautiful views of the falls
            (close to the Dam). As the waterfall is not huge, anyone can easily reach the bottom of the waterfall and
            enjoy it. <br><br>
            Kodiveri Dam locates on the Bhavani River near Satyamangalam in western Tamil Nadu. The Dam is 15 km (9.3
            miles) from Gobichettipalayam towards Satyamangalam along State Highway 15. The name ‘Kodiveri’ had derived
            from the Tamil word ‘Kodivari’, which means tiger, which refers to the forest area around the Dam where many
            tigers live. <br><br>
            The Bhavani river has its tributaries with various ups and downs, and the river's water does not complete
            the needs of the farmers of the surrounding areas. The local chief minister created a mandatory dam on the
            Bhavani River to manage the area’s water and water crises.

            Since then, the Dam has provided a regular and healthy water supply to the area. The level of irrigation in
            the surrounding area has increased, and the food grain production graph has also increased in the past.

            Conditions improved, and the area’s per capita income increased. The government took over the Kodiveri falls
            and Dam in 1937.

            It was built in 1125 AD by Soja Kongalwan of Semba Vettuvar Jayagonda. Creating a dam is like carving a
            20-foot stone wall. The stones were interlocked with iron rods, and the lead had been used as mortar.

            However, these symptoms do not appear except during the dry season when the water level in the river drops
            significantly.

            Two channels arise from the Dam; One is on the north side of the Bhavani river and the other on the south
            side is the “Arakkan Kottai Channel” and the “Tadapalli Channel”.

            The lands north of Gobichettipalayam are fertile due to the flow of the Tadapalli channel. Sugarcane and
            paddy cultivation are high in this region. The lush green fields are also a delight to watch.
