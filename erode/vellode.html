        <p>The Vellode bird sanctuary, one of the most famous bird sanctuaries in Tamil Nadu, is known as heaven for bird lovers. It is located near the temple town of Erode. It was established by The Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India in 1996 and is one of the sixteen bird sanctuaries included in the official "List of Protected Areas of Tamil Nadu". Amidst this incredibly beautiful sanctaury lies the Periyakulam Lake. Unlike other bird sanctuaries in the state, Vellode Bird Sanctuary is built around a tank and has no nearby woodlands. <br><br>

            If you're a traveller who loves bird watching, you'll be thrilled to know that this sanctuary attracts both migratory and non-migratory birds. The migratory birds usually arrive at the reserve between October and December, so plan your visit accordingly. During the monsoon season, the bird sanctuary becomes an ideal place for birds to rest and nest, as they can easily find food in the nearby lake and farming fields, and plenty of trees to take shelter in. Additionally, the abundance of fish species in the area provides a source of food for both local and migratory birds. <br><br>
            
            There are observatory towers, an interpretation centre, and a tourist canteen inside the sanctuary. You can also ask the sanctuary staff for binoculars. The best time to visit this bird sanctuary is from November to February. The entry fee is Rs.10 for adults and Rs.1 per head for student groups.</p>
