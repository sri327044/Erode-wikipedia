        <p>Born on 4th October 1904 to a small family, OKSR Kumaraswamy Mudaliar was a native of Chennimalai, which is presently Erode, Tamil Nadu. Raised by a family whose occupation was handloom weaving, young Kumaraswamy had to drop out of school by class 5.

            His family couldn’t afford his education, and he had to contribute to the income by joining the family profession.
            
            In 1923, when he was merely 19 years old, he gave in to family wishes and got married. During this time, he continued working as an assistant in the spinning mill.
            
            While the independence movement was gaining momentum in the country, Kumaran too found himself influenced. Inspired by Gandhi’s principles and ideals, Kumaran began to participate in the demonstrations announced by Bapu. <br><br>
            His family, however, began to be concerned about his growing commitment to the cause. They would visit him frequently, urging him not to get involved in the movement as there could be a danger to his life. They would even approach his workplace and would tell his colleagues to discourage him.
